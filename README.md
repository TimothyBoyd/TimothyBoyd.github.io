# 1. What are the key functions of GitHub? GitHub? Who are the users? Please use your own
words to describe them (200 words – 300 words). 
# 1. a. Github offers a platform with many key features. First it allows the users to create repositories and code that can be shared amongst other users. The domain also allows the users to change the code, merge the codes together, or simply look over the work of another person. Thirdly, github is able to host websites for the users to share to others and allows them to code whatever they desire to include within their website. The users consist of coders within teams that work on projects together. Other users may be clients or people that provide these teams with their data. Github is also a platform that allows users to store and access vast amounts of data. But as a whole the users of github consists of many different occupations. Teachers use github to share code with students, provide access to data, and even to aid students with their code. Students use github to learn the software, or practice programming. Businesses use github to create websites, store vital data within their companies, and or create teams that program, develop,  or input data and code. 
# 2. What are the differences between “clone” and “pull request” in GitHub?
# 2. a. Cloning a repository allows the user to get a duplicate or copy of the local repository and its data. Pulling a request allows the user to take the changes from a remote repository (github) to update the local version of the repository.
# 3. Introduce ONE selected “Data Set” from the [awesome-datascience] GitHub with its
URL and describe its potential applications and values.
# 3. climatedata.us is a data set that provides the users data on the current climate and changes in the climate. This can be very useful as people want to stay updated or track climate change and global warming. They would also be able to use this coinciding with wild fire maps so that they may be able to track these fires and see how the climate plays a role in these natural disasters. 
# 4. Introduce ONE selected “free-data-science-book” with its URL and author/institute
information. Explain briefly why you are interested in this book.
# 4. I will be introducing "Introduction to social network methods" http://faculty.ucr.edu/~hanneman/nettext/ by Robert A. Hanneman and Mark Riddle. In this book they detail how they split their data and users into different categories and use this information to create connections and look for patterns. I find this information very interesting because social media and the technology we have contributes so much data. Whether it be through applications, websites, cloud data, or even the data that is stored locally on our phone. this data can be used in so many ways and is centered around human data.
